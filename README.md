User Stories for the Messaging App

## Application Overview
This messaging application provides a simple and efficient platform for direct text communication between users. Any registered user can browse a list of all members, initiate a conversation by selecting another user, and exchange text messages without requiring requests. The app includes a chat list for ongoing conversations and a message view for reading and sending messages. The focus is on core messaging functionality, without additional features such as message editing, timestamps, dark-theme, and many other simple facilities.
