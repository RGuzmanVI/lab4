Write User Stories for the Messaging App

## Application Overview
This messaging application is a straightforward platform that allows any registered user to send text messages directly to any other user without needing a friend request or acceptance process. The app includes a comprehensive list of all registered users, a chat list to display ongoing one-to-one conversations, and a message view for reading and sending text messages. The focus of this lab is on the core functionality of direct communication between users, ensuring a simple and user-friendly experience.

## Instructions
Describe the App:
Begin your user stories document with a brief overview of the messaging application. Explain that users can browse a list of all registered members, initiate one-to-one text conversations directly by selecting a user from the list, and view a detailed message thread for each conversation. Mention that there is no need for friend request approvals, message editing, or deleting, and that the app focuses solely on enabling basic text communication.

## Write the User Stories:
Use the following format for each user story:

> As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that [receive a benefit].

Create user stories for different scenarios, such as:
* Viewing the complete list of users
* Initiating a conversation by selecting a user and sending a text message
* Navigating through the chat list to view ongoing conversations
* Reading the message history in a dedicated message view

Each story should include the primary goal, what the user is trying to achieve, and the key acceptance criteria (for instance, ensuring the user list displays all registered users or that the message view shows the full conversation history). This exercise will help you capture the essential requirements from the user's perspective, setting a strong foundation for the development of the Rails application.
